/**
 * \ingroup congestionOps
 *
 * \brief An implementation of TCP AdaptiveReno.
 *
 * TCP-AdaptiveReno is that it dynamically adjusts the TCP response
 * function based on congestion estimation via RTT measurement. It
 * increases congestion window faster and decreases the window less
 * significantly than TCP-Reno when it recognizes no congestion. As
 * the congestion level increases, it tunes the response function so
 * that it behaves like TCP-Reno. Simulation and experimental
 * results show that TCP-AdaptiveReno maintains friendliness to
 * TCP-Reno in networks with varying configurations, while it
 * achieves much higher throughput than TCP-Reno.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * The two main methods in the implementation are the CountAck (const TCPHeader&)
 * and the EstimateBW (int, const, Time). The CountAck method calculates
 * the number of acknowledged segments on the receipt of an ACK.
 * The EstimateBW estimates the bandwidth based on the value returned by CountAck
 * and the sampling interval (last RTT).
 *
 * WARNING: this TCP model lacks validation and regression tests; use with caution.
